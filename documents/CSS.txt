NOTE: Using IMPORT for standard (not React) CSS files generated a warning message
(see below) which I had to comment so as to ignore the message.  REQUIRE had no
such issues.

For this reason only, I replaced all IMPORTs with REQUIREs for CSS files.

I believe that IMPORT is probably the advised method but I didn't like the
messiness.

// NOTE: Error message "'bannerCss' is declared but its value is never read." is invalid:
import * as bannerCss from '../cardstack/banner.css';

require('../modules/AnimatedRadio.css');
